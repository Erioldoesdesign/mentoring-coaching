# Mentoring notes and summaries

## Focuses before next meetings

- Set up the regular meetings at regular times in calendar.

- Reaffirm what type of designer I want to be, Generalist, Manager of people, Specialist/Principle, Product Designer, Design Research, UX/UI Design etc.

- Find a designer that is 'above' me in career position and ascertain how much I want to learn from them, my levels of respect for their work and whether I want to work alongside them.

- Review my shareable projects and begin to categorise them as to what they offer me towards my career goals.

- Assess and review the work landscape where I want to focus.

- Review, reflect and create some support structures for myself in order to grow.

- Define some goals and timelines.

## Reflections

- There are very few designers working in the Non-profit space, either in large orgs or small orgs. This will never be a place that is devoid of rumor and gossip.

- Bigger orgs require more work on 'embedding' design as a practice and the value of design processes/practices in non-profit operations. Both across digital and beyond digital.

- The sector 'knows' each other and is more so within specific countries e.g. 'I thoyght everyone in the UK in non-profits all knew each other'.

- Can 'good' be done within the systems that are not explcitly for good? Where can the needle be moved outside of explicit non-profit spaces.

- It's hard to be a proficient product designer without a 'product' to work on consistently.

- What hard problems do I want to be invovled in helping to solve.

- When you work mostly in consulting and on 'project's the product isn't what you help to create, it's your expertise and if you no longer feel like an expert that is hard to sell. Growth has to be part of the product.

- How to centre myself within eisting chaos and always return to my career needs, goals and expectations.


## Realisations

- I want to work as a UX -> UI designer and digital product designer primarily.

- I want to work more directly with engineering teams again, consistently within a structured process.

- Some orgs require you to 'make' the space for what you want but it is unsupported and unthanked. Ultimately, you leave that work when you leave too.
